## Around the World Searchbar - PoC

This project is a testing app, aiming to implement, test and create preliminary features that will be later integrated into the Liferay 7 widget "Liferay Around the World": https://github.com/alffox/liferay-around-the-world-widget

Developing in this create-react-app repo before deploying to the Liferay widget has two advantages:

- Working on a small, minimal, clean project helps to identify what exactly fails, without the noise of a larger project
- A Liferay react-based widget doesn't completely behave like a create-react-app, there are differences in the code and behavior

## Technical details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
